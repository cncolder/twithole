# Hi there. This is twit hole.

## An introduction

Someone cannot visit twitter directly because... (u know)
U can find many twitter proxy site or twitter api proxy write by php, python or some other language. But why there is not ruby version?
So I deside try this way by heroku.

## How does it work?

Like normal proxy. Get ur request then post to twitter. Get the response back to u.

* Step one: clone me
	git clone git@github.com:cncolder/twithole.git 
* Step two: push me to heroku
	git push heroku master
* Step three: no step three. just use it. lol

## Thanks
